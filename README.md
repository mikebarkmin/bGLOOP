# bGLOOP
A better GLOOP.

This is a reimplementation of the [GLOOP library](http://www.brd.nrw.de/lerntreffs/informatik/structure/material/sek2/einfuehrungen/gloop.php).
It's still work in progress but all major features have already been implemented as well as some additional
cool things. However, some side features from GLOOP are still missing.
Take a look at the [project's web page](http://trent2.github.io/bGLOOP) for a short comparison of differences to
the GLOOP library (as of January 2016).

## Prerequisites
* Java JDK >= 1.7
* [jogl](http://www.jogamp.org) >= 2.3.2

## Building
* Compile by typing <code>ant</code>

## Download
If you do not want to build the bGLOOP.jar file by yourself you can [download it here](http://trent2.github.io/bGLOOP/dist/bGLOOP.jar). Also go ahead and grab the [jogamp jar files](http://jogamp.org/deployment/v2.3.2/jar/) (as described above) and place them in your classpath. You should be good now. Finally, if you want to change the default settings in the library download the <code>.bGLOOP</code> file from above, change all necessary properties, and place it in your classpath.
