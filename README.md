This is a reimplementation of the [link GLOOP library](http://www.brd.nrw.de/lerntreffs/informatik/structure/material/sek2/einfuehrungen/gloop.php).
It's still work in progress but has already an impressive number of features.
All major features from the old GLOOP library have been implemented, yet some side features
are still missing.

##Building and using

in your classpath
* start coding

## Examples
will come soon
