# bGLOOP
A better GLOOP.

This is a reimplementation of the [GLOOP library](http://www.brd.nrw.de/lerntreffs/informatik/structure/material/sek2/einfuehrungen/gloop.php).
It's still work in progress but already has an impressive number of features.
All major features from the old GLOOP library have been implemented, yet some side features
are still missing.

## Prerequisites
* Java JDK >= 1.7
* [jogl](www.jogamp.org) >= 2.3.2

## Building and using
* Compile by typing ant
* be sure to have jogl-all.jar, jogl-all-natives-???.jar, gluegen-rt.jar, and gluegen-rt-natives-???.jar along with bGLOOP.jar
in your classpath
* start coding

## Download
If you do not want to build the bGLOOP.jar file by yourself you can [download it here](http://trent2.github.io/bGLOOP/dist/bGLOOP.jar). Also go ahead and graph the [jogamp jar files](http://jogamp.org/deployment/v2.3.2/jar/) as mentioned above and place them in your classpath. You should be good now. Finally, if you want to change the default settings in the library download the <code>.bGLOOP</code> file from above, change all necessary properties, and place it in your classpath.


## Documentation
Please have a look at the [Java API documentation](http://trent2.github.io/bGLOOP/apidocs).
